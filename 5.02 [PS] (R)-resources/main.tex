\begin{question}
Let $S$ be a string of $n$ characters. Describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to compute the length of the longest substring that appears both forwards and backwards in $S$. The forward and backward substrings should not overlap.

For example, consider the following string \[S = \mathsf{BOBSMAM\textcolor{red!60!black}{ASE}\textcolor{blue!80!black}{ESA}UKULELE}.\] The algorithm should return 3 with the substring $\mathsf{ASE}$.

{\bfseries Hint.} {\em This is very similar to the palindrome problem from tutorials...}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
We use a Dynamic Programming approach by initialising an $n \times n$ array, $DP$, initialised as $0$, which still store the length of the longest common substring ending at index $i$ in the forward direction, and index $j$ in the backward direction. We will iterate through the list in two nested loops, $(i,j)$. For each:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $S[i] = S[j]$ and $i + j < n-1$, set $DP[i][j] = 1 + DP[i-1][j+1]$. To ensure the substrings don't overlap, we check $i + j < n - 1$.
\item Otherwise, set $DP[i][j]$ to $0$.
\end{itemize}

We then retrieve the maximum value from $DP$ and return the desired information once it is found. We iterate through the string over two nested loops, so clearly our time complexity is $O(n^2)$.
