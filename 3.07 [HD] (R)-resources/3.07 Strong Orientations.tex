\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 Pick a random vertex $v \in V$. Since the graph is bridgeless and connected, $v$ must have a degree of at least $2$ (as a degree of $1$ would imply there exists a bridge). Start a DFS from $v$, and as you traverse each edge for the first time, direct it away from the current vertex. When you reach a new vertex, apply the same process to all of its undirected edges. Continue this DFS process until all edges have been directed. Each vertex we reach will be reachable from $v$, and since the graph is bridgeless, there must also be a way to return to $v$ from all other vertices. Therefore, every vertex is reachable from every other vertex, ensuring a strong orientation of the graph. This algorithm runs in $O(|E|)$ time since each edge is consered at most twice: once when it is directed during the DFS traversal, and possibly once more if it is part of a backtracking step.
